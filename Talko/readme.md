Numbers 

#Functions
##Bank
For the moment I have added 4 sound banks :
0:digits (from 0 to 9) male voice
1:digits (from 0 to 9) female voice
2:big numbers (from 0 to 9999999)
3:voltmeter (reading the CV voltage)
4:frequencemeter (just saying "Hertz" instead of "Volts")
5:Spell the alphabet
6:nato alphabet

I plan to add a 7th bank with a large vocabulary and a 8th bank with weird sounds
random mode


##CV

CV signal change the words or phrases to be said

##Gate

Level high start the complete sound in trigger mode. (regardless of it's length) 
If the trigger switch is off, the gate will start the sound and hold it as long as the gate level stays up. Very useful to create crazy rhythms.


##Trigger

Choose between trigger mode or gated mode

##Bend

If bend is on, the bend pot ... distords the sound.

##Speed

Change the speed

##Pitch

Change the pitch
